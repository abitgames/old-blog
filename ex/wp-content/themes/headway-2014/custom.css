/*
To get started customizing with CSS, we recommend you 
go to http://headwaythemes.com/documentation/developer-resources/css-map/
to get started.

When writing the selectors for the elements, put body.custom at the
beginning.

For an example on how to change the background with custom CSS
we can use the following code.

body.custom {
	background: red;
}
*/
