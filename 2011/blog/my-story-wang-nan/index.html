<div class="entry-content">
<p>Hello dear readers, my name is <a href="http://abitgames.com/old-blog/author/nantas/"  target="_blank">Wang Nan</a> and this is my story as an indie game developer.</p>
<p>I got lucky, I started working for big company in game industry before I even thought about making indie games.</p>
<p>Although having been an avid gamer for years, I never thought about preparing myself into the game industry until I applied for my first job as a Level designer for Ubisoft Shanghai 6 years ago. That means I could neither code, paint or modeling at professional  or graduate level at that time. The only skill I had back then was my enthusiasm on games and ability to analyze what&#8217;s the good and bad part of a game. Lucky for me, I still got the job and have been working on levels for FPS/Action titles one after another.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s valuable experiences working for big titles in a large team. I learnt how to communicate, how to get support and how to get things done according to schedule. However working for big company and high-end titles does have its own pain, a lot. For example communication among different department is never perfect; there&#8217;re meetings for planning and then meetings for making clear what went wrong on planning meetings; you want programmer to make more feature so to spice up gameplay, but when the they updated the code you will find tons of bugs coming up; and you can never tell artist for one day to believe they are constructors but not artists, even when the stuff they build can only be watched but not played; and tight schedule makes you work overtime pretty often, to make things worse publisher will change the design of the game whatever they want and anytime they want&#8230;</p>
<p>All of the difficulties collaborating in a big team and contributing to a big title adds up to the greatness of the finished product. But as an individual, it&#8217;s really impossible to get your ideas and dreams come true, unless&#8230; you make something happen yourself.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, a game developer would know everything in the universe and is capable of pull out a whole product on his own. So that he only needs to build communication between his left and right brain. And usually the pair know each other pretty well so no stupid misunderstanding can happen, how wonderful! &#8211; Well, that&#8217;s daydream. But in a real world, I started trying to learn everything I need to build my own games.</p>
<p>My journey as a indie game developer started in 2007, actually at that time I was just a hobbyist trying to spend time on more meaningful things in spare hours. And I had no idea where to start and what&#8217;s my capability.</p>
<p>I tried XNA at first, took me quite a while to write up the first couple of loops to display the canvas. Then it&#8217;s time for animated sprites. I decided not to write it from scratch so I did a search for tools and libraries, then I found Torque Game Builder.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Torque Game Builder" src="http://webclass.superquest.net/gamemaker-projects/Vickie%20Brown/documentation/Overview_Images/TGB_Logo.png" alt="Torque Game Builder" width="500" height="100" /></p>
<p>It may sound hilarious to indie veterans how didn&#8217;t I know anything about indie game engines and how to make it work. But that&#8217;s bloody truth for a Level designer worked for 4 shipped AAA titles: I was not even sure whether I should write a game from bottom up, not to say how to choose indie engines and middlewares. Fortunately TGB had quite a few comprehensive tutorial and example project to begin with. I followed and finished all the tutorial of TGB that I could find and thought I&#8217;m ready to make my dream come true.</p>
<p>One of my dream as a game developer is to make an SRPG with collectible and trad-able skill cards. I knew it was a big idea but back then I was too excited to get start with my dream so there was no planning or resource/technique analysis before I created my new project in TGB.</p>
<p>It was predictable. I spent months working on design documents and prototyping. The result was 3 huge mind-maps and a couple of scenes with selectable and movable player sprite. Before I realize I&#8217;m not getting anywhere with my dream project, I got a phone call from one of my old colleague. He was a designer working for a big studio as well and he was looking for a partner to start developing iPhone games because iPhone game developers were reported to have been making good money.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="iPhone Games" src="http://odopod.com/assets/imgcache/images/iphone-2billion-apps_____624x0.jpg" alt="iPhone Games" width="499" height="281" /></p>
<p>Just like that I dropped my dream project and got myself an iMac, and started learning Obj-C and Core Graphics! I downloaded and followed Stanford&#8217;s iPhone development course. It was nice but as you can predict, all these iPhone development stuff I learnt during that time helps so little with making a game. Then the guy called me dropped because programming for iPhone games is not as easy as it seemed to be for a designer&#8230; and to make things even crazier I started to learn OpenGL ES.</p>
<p>Maybe you wanted to asked me several times already, why couldn&#8217;t I find approaches that I can manage. I think I looked so funny at that time because of several facts:</p>
<p>1. Working in a studio and working on your own project are so different. In console game industry I&#8217;m a veteran and professional Level designer capable of design and build a level from scratch and integrate anything they throw at me into the level because I got technical support, assets creators and years of experience in the game engine. I thought my professional experience can help me quickly get started with my own project but since I didn&#8217;t have any resource or backups, it was just impossible.</p>
<p>2. I should never begin with something big, even if it&#8217;s a project I dream to make happen. Actually started with TGB is not a bad idea, I would have a chance to finish and publish something if I started really small.</p>
<p>3. For indie developers, don&#8217;t form a team with one of your kind unless you both know how to play different roles. My designer friend thought we can both learn to program and then we have double the amount of good ideas. Unfortunately both never happened. You should always try to find collaborators who can play your complementary role.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Berlin" src="http://www.seeklogo.com/images/E/Eisbaeren_Berlin_-_Berlin_Polar_Bears-logo-81E9779FC3-seeklogo.com.gif" alt="Berlin" width="200" height="200" /></p>
<p>My 2008 and early 2009 passed just like that, trying different way to get my own project going but finished nothing. During that time I relocated from Shanghai to Berlin, started working on the exciting upcoming title &#8220;The Line&#8221; for Yager. Life in Berlin is much less stressful compare to Shanghai and I&#8217;m having more spare time and can focus more in my spare time. The idea of going indie never died.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Unity3d" src="http://www.untoldentertainment.com/blog/img/2009_09_11/unityLogo.jpg" alt="Unity3d" width="327" height="180" /></p>
<p>In late 2009 Unity Indie went free and I was able to catch that news. Actually I didn&#8217;t know Unity was such a great engine until then. I spent several months to learn the basic of Unity slowly and getting ready to start project again.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, this time I ran into <a href="http://abitgames.com/old-blog/author/jwu/"  target="_blank">Wu Jie</a> (aka Karas) on MSN. He&#8217;s a really good programmer and my old friend. We worked together back in Shanghai. I was asking him about how did some C# code snippet I found from UnityWiki worked. He answered my question and told me he&#8217;s using Unity as well. Then I asked &#8220;How about we team up and start making games?&#8221; And he was thinking about the same thing.</p>
<p>We started concept design and prototyping right away and getting gameplay pieces playable one after another. That&#8217;s how the story twisted after I finally got a reliable programmer help me with all the mysterious code puzzles. Later on we found <a href="http://abitgames.com/old-blog/author/summercards/" >Zhuang Menghong</a> (aka Summercards) as our Artist. And that&#8217;s how we started aBit Games.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="aBit Games" src="http://abitgames.com/old-blog/ex/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/logo02.png" alt="aBit Games" width="360" height="89" /></p>
<p>We have been collaborating for 6 month and it&#8217;s looking really great right now. I&#8217;m still acting as my &#8220;jack-of-all-trade&#8221; player but I can focus more on design, creation of models and animations &#8211; in other words, things I can handle well. Since we begin this blog, we will also share knowledge and solution at our best. I&#8217;m still only using my spare time for indie stuff but with all the lessons I have learnt and my rocking team, it&#8217;s time to get some serious job done.</p>
<p>This article will end here as my search for a entrance to indie game development stopped. But our search for approaches to making successful games will continue. Our journey and stories as aBit Games, a new indie game developing studio has just began.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
